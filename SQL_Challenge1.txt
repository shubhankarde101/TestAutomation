    AND 
        ORDER_DATE <= (SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(ORDER_DATE), INTERVAL 10 YEAR) FROM ORDERS)
)

from worker w2
group by w2.department
having w1.salary=mal)

where t1.co1=(t2.co2+1)) as sales_difference
from 
(SELECT sales.*, @counter2 := @counter2 +1 as co1
FROM (select @counter2:=0) R2, sales
ORDER BY sales_date) t1)t3
where t3.sales_difference<0

Prepare the org chart for the employees in the company starting from the top to bottom hierarchy along with the level.
The top most position is identified as the manger id being empty or null.
Write a query to display the level, employee_id, first_name, last_name, manager_id in an hierarchy tree

using Recursive common Table Expression in mySQL

WITH RECURSIVE EmployeesR (level, employee_id, first_name, last_name, manager_id) AS
(
  SELECT 1 level,employee_id, first_name, last_name,manager_id
    FROM Employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT cp.level + 1, c.employee_id, c.first_name,c.last_name,c.manager_id
    FROM EmployeesR AS cp JOIN Employees AS c
      ON cp.employee_id = c.manager_id
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeesR
